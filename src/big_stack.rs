//! Run async work on a dedicated thread with a large stack.
//!
//! ssi's JSON-LD context expansion (used by `ssi-claims`'s data-integrity
//! signing) recurses deep enough to blow iOS's default ~512 KB child-thread
//! stack on realistic credentials. macOS and Linux give threads 2+ MB by
//! default so this only manifests on iOS (and crashes show up as
//! `EXC_BAD_ACCESS code=2` — guard-page hit).
//!
//! [`run_async`] spawns a fresh OS thread with an 8 MB stack, runs a
//! single-threaded `tokio` runtime on it, drives the supplied future to
//! completion, and ferries the result back via a oneshot channel.
//!
//! Use this for **anything that does ssi JSON-LD work** when the public API is
//! ultimately exposed through UniFFI to mobile platforms.
//!
//! ## Duplicated from sprucekit-mobile, deliberately
//!
//! This is a verbatim copy of `sprucekit-mobile/rust/src/big_stack.rs`. VCALM
//! needs it for the VP build-and-sign hop, which is VCALM's own logic and so
//! cannot move behind [`crate::ports::VcalmLdEngine`] (the engine port owns the
//! hop for verification and SD derivation, which is why those call sites no
//! longer appear here).
//!
//! The module is pure infrastructure — no policy, no security surface — so a
//! copy is cheaper than a shared crate. The one thing to watch: if the 8 MB
//! constant is ever raised to accommodate a deeper credential, BOTH copies must
//! change. A mismatch surfaces only as an iOS-only stack crash.
